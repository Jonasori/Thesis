abstract = {We introduce the Ophiuchus DIsc Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA), a project aiming to study the entire population of Spitzer-selected protoplanetary discs in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud (∼300 objects) from both millimeter continuum and CO isotopologues data. Here we present 1.3 mm/230 GHz continuum images of 147 targets at 0.2 (28 au) resolution and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy. We detect a total of 133 discs, including the individual components of 11 binary systems and 1 triple system. Fifty-three of these discs are spatially resolved. We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in 8 of the sources and hints of such structures in another 4 discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only ∼50 discs (∼1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M ⊕ core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained. The distribution in continuum disc sizes in our sample is heavily weighted towards compact discs: most detected discs have radii {\textless} 15 au, while only 23 discs (∼15{\%} of the targets) have radii {\textgreater} 30 au.},

abstract = {We have analyzed nearly all images of the Taurus star-forming region at 3.6-24um that were obtained during the cryogenic mission of the Spitzer Space Telescope (46 deg{\^{}}2) and have measured photometry for all known members of the region that are within these data, corresponding to 348 sources. We have classified the members of Taurus according to whether they show evidence of disks and envelopes (classes I, II, and III). The disk fraction in Taurus is 75{\%} for solar-mass stars and declines to 45{\%} for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (0.01-0.3 M{\_}sun). This dependence on stellar mass is similar to that measured for Cha I, although the disk fraction in Taurus is slightly higher overall, probably because of its younger age (1 vs. 2-3 Myr). In comparison, the disk fraction for solar-mass stars is much lower (20{\%}) in IC 348 and Sigma Ori, which are denser than Taurus and Cha I and are roughly coeval with the latter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer in regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple epochs of photometry that are available for {\~{}}200 Taurus members, we find that stars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-IR variability than diskless stars. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the criteria for primordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The number ratio of evolved and transitional disks to primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for K5-M5, indicating a timescale of 0.15 x tau(primordial)=0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner regions of optically thick disks. After applying the same criteria to older clusters (2-10 Myr), we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional disks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when their star formation histories are properly taken into account. ERRATUM: In Table 7, we inadvertently omitted the spectral type bins in which class II sources were placed in Table 8 based on their bolometric luminosities (applies only to stars that lack spectroscopic classifications). The bins were K6-M3.5 for FT Tau, DK Tau B, and IRAS 04370+2559, M3.5-M6 for IRAS 04200+2759, IT Tau B, and ITG 1, and M6-M8 for IRAS 04325+2402 C. In addition, the values of K{\_}s-[3.6] in Table 13 and Figure 26 for spectral types of M4-M9 are incorrect. We present corrected versions of Table 13 and Figure 26.},

abstract = {We present ∼0 4 resolution images of CO(3–2) and associated continuum emission from the gas-bearing debris disk around the nearby A star 49 Ceti, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We analyze the ALMA visibilities in tandem with the broadband spectral energy distribution to measure the radial surface density profiles of dust and gas emission from the system. The dust surface density decreases with radius between ∼100 and 310 au, with a marginally significant enhancement of surface density at a radius of ∼110 au. The SED requires an inner disk of small grains in addition to the outer disk of larger grains resolved by ALMA. The gas disk exhibits a surface density profile that increases with radius, contrary to most previous spatially resolved observations of circumstellar gas disks. While ∼80{\%} of the CO flux is well described by an axisymmetric power-law disk in Keplerian rotation about the central star, residuals at ∼20{\%} of the peak flux exhibit a departure from axisymmetry suggestive of spiral arms or a warp in the gas disk. The radial extent of the gas disk (∼220 au) is smaller than that of the dust disk (∼300 au), consistent with recent observations of other gas-bearing debris disks. While there are so far only three broad debris disks with wellcharacterized radial dust profiles at millimeter wavelengths, 49 Ceti's disk shows a markedly different structure from two radially resolved gas-poor debris disks, implying that the physical processes generating and sculpting the gas and dust are fundamentally different.},

abstract = {Gas in protostellar disks provides the raw material for giant planet formation and controls the dynamics of the planetesimal-building dust grains. Accurate gas mass measurements help map the observed properties of planet-forming disks onto the formation environments of known exoplanets. Rare isotopologues of carbon monoxide (CO) have been used as gas mass tracers for disks in the Lupus star-forming region, with an assumed interstellar CO/H{\$}{\_}2{\$} abundance ratio. Unfortunately, observations of T-Tauri disks show that CO abundance is not interstellar---a finding reproduced by models that show CO abundance decreasing both with distance from the star and as a function of time. Here we present radiative transfer simulations that assess the accuracy of CO-based disk mass measurements. We find that the combination of CO chemical depletion in the outer disk and optically thick emission from the inner disk leads observers to underestimate gas mass by more than an order of magnitude if they use the standard assumptions of interstellar CO/H{\$}{\_}2{\$} ratio and optically thin emission. Furthermore, CO abundance changes on million-year timescales, introducing an age/mass degeneracy into observations. To reach factor of a few accuracy for CO-based disk mass measurements, we suggest that observers and modelers adopt the following strategies: (1) select the low-{\$}J{\$} transitions; (2) observe multiple CO isotopologues and use either intensity ratios or normalized line profiles to diagnose CO chemical depletion; and (3) use spatially resolved observations to measure the CO abundance distribution.},

abstract = {The {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} Orionis cluster is important for studying protoplanetary disk evolution, as its intermediate age ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}3-5 Myr) is comparable to the median disk lifetime. We use ALMA to conduct a high-sensitivity survey of dust and gas in 92 protoplanetary disks around {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} Orionis members with {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}\backslashgtrsim0.1 M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. Our observations cover the 1.33 mm continuum and several CO {\$}J=2-1{\$} lines: out of 92 sources, we detect 37 in the mm continuum and six in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO, three in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}CO, and none in C{\$}{\^{}}{\{}18{\}}{\$}O. Using the continuum emission to estimate dust mass, we find only 11 disks with {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}\backslashgtrsim10 M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$}, indicating that after only a few Myr of evolution most disks lack sufficient dust to form giant planet cores. Stacking the individually undetected continuum sources limits their average dust mass to 5{\$}\backslashtimes{\$} lower than that of the faintest detected disk, supporting theoretical models that indicate rapid dissipation once disk clearing begins. Comparing the protoplanetary disk population in {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} Orionis to those of other star-forming regions supports the steady decline in average dust mass and the steepening of the {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$}-{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} relation with age; studying these evolutionary trends can inform the relative importance of different disk processes during key eras of planet formation. External photoevaporation from the central O9 star is influencing disk evolution throughout the region: dust masses clearly decline with decreasing separation from the photoionizing source, and the handful of CO detections exist at projected separations {\$}{\textgreater}1.5{\$} pc. Collectively, our findings indicate that giant planet formation is inherently rare and/or well underway by a few Myr of age.},

abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the last 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded cluster properties. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within roughly 2 Kpc of the Sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7{\%} of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90{\%}) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 solar masses. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the IMF which, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to subsellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

abstract = {Turbulence can transport angular momentum in protoplanetary disks and influence the growth and evolution of planets. With spatially and spectrally resolved molecular emission line measurements provided by (sub)millimeter interferometric observations, it is possible to directly measure non-thermal motions in the disk gas that can be attributed to this turbulence. We report a new constraint on the turbulence in the disk around HD 163296, a nearby young A star, determined from ALMA Science Verification observations of four CO emission lines (the CO(3-2), CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1), and C18O(2-1) transitions). The different optical depths for these lines permit probes of non-thermal line-widths at a range of physical conditions (temperature and density) and depths into the disk interior. We derive stringent limits on the non-thermal motions in the upper layers of the outer disk such that any contribution to the line-widths from turbulence is {\textless}3{\%} of the local sound speed. These limits are approximately an order of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions for full-blown MHD turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability, potentially suggesting that this mechanism is less efficient in the outer (R{\textgreater}30AU) disk than has been previously considered.},

abstract = {We present observational evidence of environmental effects on the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We combine catalogues of resolved protoplanetary discs (PPDs) and young stellar objects in the solar neighbourhood to analyse the PPD size distribution as a function of ambient stellar density. By running Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between the PPD radii at different densities, we find empirical evidence, at the {\textgreater}97{\%} confidence level, for a change in the PPD radius distribution at ambient stellar densities $\backslash$Sigma {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}3.5{\}} pc{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}. This coincides with a simple theoretical estimate for the truncation of PPDs or planetary systems by dynamical encounters. If this agreement is causal, the ongoing disruption of PPDs and planetary systems limits the possible existence of planets in the habitable zone, with shorter lifetimes at higher host stellar masses and ambient densities. Therefore, habitable planets are not likely to be present in long-lived stellar clusters, and may have been ejected altogether to form a population of unbound, free-floating planets. We conclude that, while highly suggestive, our results should be verified through other methods. Our simple model shows that truncations should lead to a measurable depletion of the PPD mass function that can be detected with ALMA observations of the densest nearby and young clusters.},

abstract = {We report ALMA observations of CO(3-2) emission in a sample of 7 Seyfert/LINER galaxies at the unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.1'' = 4-9 pc. Our aim is to explore the close environment of AGN, and the dynamical structures leading to its fueling. The selected galaxies host low-luminosity AGN, and have a wide range of activity types, and barred or ringed morphologies. The observed maps reveal the existence of circum-nuclear disk structures, defined by their morphology and decoupled kinematics. We call these structures "molecular tori", even though they appear often as disks, without holes in the center. They have varied orientations, unaligned with their host galaxy. The radius of the tori ranges from 6 to 27 pc, and their mass from 0.7 10{\$}{\^{}}7{\$} to 3.9 10{\$}{\^{}}7{\$} Msun. At larger scale, the gas is always piled up in a few 100{\~{}}pc scale resonant rings, that play the role of a reservoir to fuel the nucleus. In some cases, a trailing spiral is observed inside the ring, providing evidence for feeding processes. Most frequently, the torus and the AGN are slightly off-centered, with respect to the bar-resonant ring position, implying that the black hole is wandering by a few 10{\~{}}pc amplitude around the center of mass of the galaxy. Our spatial resolution allows us to measure gas velocities inside the sphere of influence of the central black holes. By fitting the observations with different simulated cubes, varying the torus inclination and the black hole mass, it is possible to estimate the mass of the central black hole, which is in general difficult for such late-type galaxies, with only a pseudo-bulge.},

abstract = {Context. The gas mass of protoplanetary disks and the gas-to-dust ratio are two key elements driving the evolution of these disks and the formation of planetary system. Aims. We explore to what extent CO (or its isotopologues) can be used as a tracer of gas mass. Methods. We use a detailed gas-grain chemical model and study the evolution of the disk composition, starting from a dense prestellar core composition. We explore a range of disk temperature profiles, cosmic-ray ionization rates, and disk ages for a disk model representative of T Tauri stars. Results. At the high densities that prevail in disks, we find that because of fast reactions on grain surfaces, CO can be converted to less volatile forms (principally s-CO 2 , and to a lesser extent s-CH 4) instead of being evaporated over a wide range of temperature. The canonical gas-phase abundance of 10 −4 is only reached above about 30–35 K. The dominant carbon bearing entity depends on the temperature structure and age of the disk. The chemical evolution of CO is also sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate. Larger gas phase CO abundances are found in younger disks. Initial conditions, such as parent cloud age and density, have a limited impact. Conclusions. This study reveals that CO gas-phase abundance is heavily dependent on grain surface processes, which remain very incompletely understood so far. The strong dependence on dust temperature profile makes CO a poor tracer of the gas-phase content of disks.},

abstract = {Turbulence is a fundamental parameter in models of grain growth during the early stages of planet formation. As such, observational constraints on its magnitude are crucial. Here we self-consistently analyze ALMA CO(2-1), SMA CO(3-2), and SMA CO(6-5) observations of the disk around TW Hya and find an upper limit on the turbulent broadening of {\$}{\textless}{\$}0.08c{\$}{\_}s{\$} ({\$}\backslashalpha{\textless}{\$}0.007 for {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} defined only within 2-3 pressure scale heights above the midplane), lower than the tentative detection previously found from an analysis of the CO(2-1) data. We examine in detail the challenges of image plane fitting vs directly fitting the visibilities, while also considering the role of the vertical temperature gradient, systematic uncertainty in the amplitude calibration, and assumptions about the CO abundance, as potential sources of the discrepancy in the turbulence measurements. These tests result in variations of the turbulence limit between {\$}{\textless}{\$}0.04c{\$}{\_}s{\$} and {\$}{\textless}{\$}0.13c{\$}{\_}s{\$}, consistently lower than the 0.2-0.4c{\$}{\_}s{\$} found previously. Having ruled out numerous factors, we restrict the source of the discrepancy to our assumed coupling between temperature and density through hydrostatic equilibrium in the presence of a vertical temperature gradient and/or the confinement of CO to a thin molecular layer above the midplane, although further work is needed to quantify the influence of these prescriptions. Assumptions about hydrostatic equilibrium and the CO distribution are physically motivated, and may have a small influence on measuring the kinematics of the gas, but they become important when constraining small effects such as the strength of the turbulence within a protoplanetary disk.},

abstract = {We explore the chemical structure of a disk that contains a large central gap of R {\~{}} 45 AU, as is commonly seen in transitional disk systems. In our chemical model of a disk with a cleared inner void, the midplane becomes revealed to the central star so that it is directly irradiated. The midplane material at the truncation radius is permissive to reprocessed optical heating radiation, but opaque to the photodissociating ultraviolet, creating an environment abundant in gas-phase molecules. Thus the disk midplane, which would otherwise for a full disk be dominated by near complete heavy element freeze-out, should become observable in molecular emission. If this prediction is correct this has exciting prospects for observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, as the inner transition region should thus be readily detected and resolved, especially using high-J rotational transitions excited in the high density midplane gas. Therefore, such observations will potentially provide us with a direct probe of the physics and chemistry at this actively evolving interface.},

abstract = {Many extrasolar planets follow orbits that differ from the nearly coplanar and circular orbits found in our Solar System; their orbits may be eccentric or inclined with respect to the host star's equator, and the population of giant planets orbiting close to their host stars suggests appreciable orbital migration. There is at present no consensus on what produces such orbits. Theoretical explanations often invoke interactions with a binary companion star in an orbit that is inclined relative to the planet's orbital plane. Such mechanisms require significant mutual inclinations between the planetary and binary star orbital planes. The protoplanetary disks in a few young binaries are misaligned, but often the measurements of these misalignments are sensitive only to a small portion of the inner disk, and the three-dimensional misalignment of the bulk of the planet-forming disk mass has hitherto not been determined. Here we report that the protoplanetary disks in the young binary system HK Tauri are misaligned by 60 to 68 degrees, such that one or both of the disks are significantly inclined to the binary orbital plane. Our results demonstrate that the necessary conditions exist for misalignment-driven mechanisms to modify planetary orbits, and that these conditions are present at the time of planet formation, apparently because of the binary formation process.},

abstract = {Gap-like structures in protoplanetary disks are likely related to planet formation processes. In this paper, we present and analyze high resolution (0.17*0.11 arcsec) 1.3 mm ALMA continuum observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480. Our observations for the first time show a gap centered at {\~{}}74au with a width of {\~{}}23au, surrounded by a bright ring centered at {\~{}}98au from the central star. Detailed radiative transfer modeling of both the ALMA image and the broadband spectral energy distribution is used to constrain the surface density profile and structural parameters of the disk. If the width of the gap corresponds to 4{\~{}}8 times the Hill radius of a single forming planet, then the putative planet would have a mass of 0.4{\~{}}3 M{\_}Jup. We test this prediction by performing global three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic gas/dust simulations of disks hosting a migrating and accreting planet. We find that the dust emission across the disk is consistent with the presence of an embedded planet with a mass of {\~{}}2.3 M{\_}Jup at an orbital radius of {\~{}}78au. Given the surface density of the best-fit radiative transfer model, the amount of depleted mass in the gap is higher than the mass of the putative planet, which satisfies the basic condition for the formation of such a planet.},

abstract = {Star formation is spatially clustered across a range of environments, from dense stellar clusters to unbound associations. As a result, radiative or dynamical interactions with neighbouring stars disrupt (proto)planetary systems and limit their radii, leaving a lasting impact on their potential habitability. In the solar neighbourhood, we find that the vast majority of stars form in unbound associations, such that the interaction of (proto)planetary systems with neighbouring stars is limited to the densest sub-regions. However, the fraction of star formation occurring in compact clusters was considerably higher in the past, peaking at {\~{}}50{\%} in the young Milky Way at redshift z{\~{}}2. These results demonstrate that the large-scale star formation environment affects the demographics of planetary systems and the occupation of the habitable zone. We show that planet formation is governed by multi-scale physics, in which Mpc-scale events such as galaxy mergers affect the AU-scale properties of (proto)planetary systems.},

abstract = {We have investigated the two-dimensional (R,Z) distribution of deuterated molecular species in circumstellar disks around young stellar objects. The abundance ratios between singly deuterated and normal molecules (``D/H ratios'') in disks evolve in a similar way as in molecular clouds. Fractionation is caused by rapid exchange reactions that are exothermic because of energy differences between deuterated and normal species. In the midplane region, where molecules are heavily depleted onto grain surfaces, the D/H ratios of gaseous molecules are higher than at larger heights. The D/H ratios for the vertical column densities of NH3, H2O, and HCO+ are sensitive to the temperature, and decrease significantly with decreasing radial distance for R {\textless} 300 AU. The analogous D/H ratios for CH4 and H2CO, on the other hand, are not very sensitive to the temperature in the range (T=10-50 K) we are concerned with, and do not decrease with decreasing R at R {\textgreater} 50 AU. The D/H column-density ratios also depend on disk mass. In a disk with a larger mass, the ratios of deuterated species to normal species are higher, because of heavier depletion of molecules onto grains. In the second part of the paper, we report molecular column densities for disks embedded in ambient cloud gas. Our results suggest that CN and HCO+ can be tracers of gaseous disks, especially if the central object is a strong X-ray source. Our results also suggest that the radial distributions of CN, C2H, HCN, and H2CO may vary among disks depending on the X-ray luminosity of the central star.},

abstract = {We explore the effects of progenitor pre-stellar core properties on the evolution of disks with external photoevaporation in clusters. Since the strength of external photoevaporation is largely determined by the depth of the gravitational potential well of the disk, the external photoevaporation rate is the function of star mass and disk size. The properties of a core collapse set up the initial conditions of protoplanetary disks, so they influence the evolutions of star mass and disk size. Our calculations show that the core properties can dramatically influence the efficiency of external photoevaporation. For the core with low angular velocity, most core mass directly falls onto the central star or onto the disk near the star. External photoevaporation is suppressed even if external radiation from nearby massive stars are strong. In this case, the disk evolution in clusters is primarily driven by its own internal viscosity. However, if the core angular velocity is high, most core mass falls onto the disk far from the central star. External photoevaporation is so strong that the disk mass is severely evaporated. Finally, the star mass is very low and the disk lifetime is very short. Our calculations could interpret some observational features of disks in clusters, such as the diameter distribution of disks in the Trapezium cluster and the correlation between mass accretion rate and star mass. We suggest that the disk mass determined by (sub)millimeter wavelength observations may be underestimated.},

abstract = {The disks that surround young stars are mostly composed of molecular gas, which is harder to detect and interpret than the accompanying dust. Disk mass measurements have therefore relied on large and uncertain extrapolations from the dust to the gas. We have developed a grid of models to study the dependencies of isotopologue CO line strengths on disk structure and temperature parameters and find that a combination of 13CO and C18O observations provides a robust measure of the gas mass. We apply this technique to Submillimeter Array observations of nine circumstellar disks and published measurements of six well studied disks. We find evidence for selective photodissociation of C18O and determine masses to within a factor of about three. The inferred masses for the nine disks in our survey range from 0.7-6 M{\_}Jup, and all are well below the extrapolation from the interstellar medium gas-to-dust ratio of 100. This is consistent with the low masses of planets found around such stars, and may be due to accretion or photoevaporation of a dust-poor upper atmosphere. However, the masses may be underestimated if there are more efficient CO depletion pathways than those known in molecular clouds and cold cores.},

We investigate here a new method based on the different opacities of the CO isotopomers to sample the temperature disk structure at various vertical scales inside the disk. Typically, the 12 CO transitions are sampling at 2–4 scale heights, while the 13 CO data are more likely tracing 1 scale height for the J = 2–1, and the disk mid-plane for the J = 1–0 line. At the disk scale at which the IRAM observations are sensitive (R ≥ 50–60 AU), the analysis reveals a vertical temperature gradient. The outer layers where $\tau$(12 CO J = 2 → 1) 1 are warmer (∼30 K) than the inner layers probed by 13 CO and C 18 O data (∼13–20 K). These findings are consistent with the structure expected for flared irradiated disks around TTauri stars. We also observe that the outer radius of the disk is smaller in 13 CO and C 18 O than in 12 CO. These differences in truncation radius are in agreement with photodissociation effects. We also note that the dynamical mass determination from CO is weakly affected by the temperature gradient.},

The J=2-1 emission from 12CO and its main isotopologues have no resolved spatial asymmetry. We associate this behavior as the direct signature of a vertical temperature gradient and layered molecular structure in the disk. This is demonstrated using both toy models and more sophisticated calculations assuming non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non LTE) conditions. A model disk structure is developed to reproduce both the distinctive spatial morphology of the 12CO J=3-2 line as well as the J=2-1 emission from the CO isotopologues assuming relative abundances consistent with the interstellar medium. This model disk structure has tau=1 emitting surfaces for the 12CO emission lines that make an angle of about 15 degrees with respect to the disk midplane. Furthermore, we show that the spatial and spectral sensitivity of these data can distinguish between models that have sub-Keplerian gas velocities due to the vertical extent of the disk and its associated radial pressure gradient (a fractional difference in the bulk gas velocity field of approximately greater than 5{\%}).},

The observations have been carried out in five photometric filters nearly equivalent to the standard B, V, H$\alpha$, I, and z passbands. Our master catalog lists 178 externally ionized protoplanetary disks (proplyds), 28 disks seen only in absorption against the bright nebular background (silhouette disks), eight disks seen only as dark lanes at the midplane of extended polar emission (bipolar nebulae or reflection nebulae), and five sources showing jet emission with no evidence of either external ionized gas emission or dark silhouette disks. Many of these disks are associated with jets seen in H$\alpha$ and circumstellar material detected through reflection emission in our broadband filters; approximately two-thirds have identified counterparts in X-rays. A total of 47 objects (29 proplyds, seven silhouette disks, six bipolar nebulae, five jets with no evidence of proplyd emission or silhouette disk) are new detections with HST. We include in our list four objects previously reported as circumstellar disks, which have not been detected in our HST/ACS images either because they are hidden by the bleeding trails of a nearby saturated bright star or because of their location out of the HST/ACS Treasury Program field. The other 31 sources previously reported as extended objects do not harbor a stellar source in our HST/ACS images. We also report on the detection of 16 red, elongated sources. Their location at the edges of the field, far from the Trapezium cluster core (gsim10'), suggests that these are probably background galaxies observed through low-extinction regions of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1).},

First, we explore analytically the lensing properties of the model, finding that a pure WaveDM density profile, the soliton profile, produces a weaker lensing effect than similar cored profiles. Then, we analyze models with a soliton embedded within a Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) profile, as has been found in numerical simulations of structure formation. We use a benchmark model with a boson mass of m a =10 −22 eV, for which we see that there is a bimodality in the contribution of the external NFW part of the profile, and some of the free parameters associated with it are not well constrained. We find that for configurations with boson masses 10 −23 to 10 −22 eV, a range of masses preferred by dwarf galaxy kinematics, the soliton profile alone can fit the data, but its size is incompatible with the luminous extent of the lens galaxies. Likewise, boson masses of the order of 10 −21 eV, which would be consistent with Ly$\alpha$ constraints and consist of more compact soliton configurations, necessarily require the NFW part in order to reproduce the observed Einstein radii. We then conclude that lens systems impose a conservative lower bound m a {\textgreater}10 −24 eV and that the NFW envelope around the soliton must be present to satisfy the observational requirements.},

Using 230 and 345 GHz continuum and CO J=3-2 data from the Submillimeter Array for four nearby disk systems (HD 163296, TW Hydrae, GM Aurigae, and MWC 480), we examine models of circumstellar disk structure and the effects of their treatment of the outer disk edge. We show that for these disks, models described by power laws in surface density and temperature that are truncated at an outer radius are incapable of reproducing both the gas and dust emission simultaneously: the outer radius derived from the dust continuum emission is always significantly smaller than the extent of the molecular gas disk traced by CO emission. However, a simple model motivated by similarity solutions of the time evolution of accretion disks that includes a tapered exponential edge in the surface density distribution (and the same number of free parameters) does much better at reproducing both the gas and dust emission. While this analysis does not rule out the disparate radii implied by the truncated power-law models, a realistic alternative disk model, grounded in the physics of accretion, provides a consistent picture for the extent of both the gas and dust.},

The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations.

We use a sophisticated physical model, which includes a robust treatment of the radiative transfer of UV and X-ray radiation, and calculate the time-dependent chemical structure using a comprehensive chemical network. In previouswork,we approximated the photochemistry and X-ray ionization; here, we recalculate the photoreaction rates using the explicitUVwavelength spectrum and wavelength-dependent reaction cross sections. We recalculate the X-ray ionization rate using our explicit elemental composition and X-ray energy spectrum. We find that photochemistry has a larger influence on the molecular composition than X-ray ionization. Observable molecules sensitive to the photorates include OH, HCO+,N2H+,H2O, CO2, and CH3OH. The only molecule significantly affected by the X-ray ionization is N2H+, indicating that it is safe to adopt existing approximations of the X-ray ionization rate in typical T Tauri star–disk systems.Therecalculation of the photorates increases the abundances of neutralmolecules in the outer disk, highlighting the importance of taking into account the shape of the UV spectrum in protoplanetary disks. A recalculation of the photoreaction rates also affects the gas-phase chemistry due to the adjustment of the H/H2 and C+/C ratios. The disk ionization fraction is not significantly affected by themethods adopted to calculate the photochemistry and X-ray ionization. We determine that there is a probable “dead zone” where accretion is suppressed, present in a layer, Z/R ? 0.1–0.2, in the disk midplane, within R ≈ 200 AU.},

The submillimeter detection rate is 61{\%} to a completeness limit of {\~{}}10 mJy (3 $\sigma$) at 850 $\mu$m. The inferred circumstellar disk masses are lognormally distributed with a mean mass of {\~{}}5×10-3 Msolar and a large dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one-third of the submillimeter sources have disk masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The median disk-to-star mass ratio is 0.5{\%}. The empirical behavior of the submillimeter continuum is best described as F$\nu${\~{}}$\nu$2.0+/-0.5 between 350 $\mu$m and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the opacity compared to the interstellar medium. The latter effect could be due to a substantial population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer disks is removed nearly simultaneously.},

This is partly because it is very difficult to spatially resolve these regions with current telescopes. But it is also because the physics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts to evaporate, is poorly understood. With infrared interferometry it has become possible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner AU of protoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. These observations have partly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questions and puzzles. Moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of these regions is extremely challenging.

abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of {\~{}}102-104 higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an $\alpha$-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter $\alpha$ = 10-3 are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities ($\alpha$ = 10-2) disks are dispersed within {\~{}}0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than {\~{}}100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

In our chemical model of a disk with a cleared inner void, the midplane becomes revealed to the central star so that it is directly irradiated. The midplane material at the truncation radius is permissive to reprocessed optical heating radiation, but opaque to the photodissociating ultraviolet, creating an environment abundant in gas-phase molecules. Thus the disk midplane, which would otherwise for a full disk be dominated by near complete heavy element freeze-out, should become observable in molecular emission. If this prediction is correct this has exciting prospects for observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, as the inner transition region should thus be readily detected and resolved, especially using high-J rotational transitions excited in the high density midplane gas. Therefore, such observations will potentially provide us with a direct probe of the physics and chemistry at this actively evolving interface.},

An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 were detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include OB stars, $\theta$1 OriC,and $\theta$1 Ori F, range from 0.1 to 0.6 Mjup. Combining these ALMA data with previous Submillimeter Array observations, we find a lack of massive ({\textgreater}{\~{}} 3 Mjup) disks in the extreme-UV-dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of $\theta$1 Ori C. At larger separations from $\theta$1 Ori C, in the far-UV-dominated region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in the extreme-UV-dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the far-UV-dominated regions relatively unaffected.},

abstract = {There is growing theoretical and observational evidence that protoplanetary disc evolution may be significantly affected by the canonical levels of far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation found in a star forming environment, leading to substantial stripping of material from the disc outer edge even in the absence of nearby massive stars. In this paper we perform the first full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the flow from the outer rim of protoplanetary discs externally irradiated by such intermediate strength FUV fields, including direct modelling of the photon dominated region (PDR) which is required to accurately compute the thermal properties. We find excellent agreement between our models and the semi-analytic models of Facchini et al. (2016) for the profile of the flow itself, as well as the mass loss rate and location of their "critical radius". This both validates their results (which differed significantly from prior semi-analytic estimates) and our new numerical method, the latter of which can now be applied to elements of the problem that the semi--analytic approaches are incapable of modelling. We also obtain the composition of the flow, but given the simple geometry of our models we can only hint at some diagnostics for future observations of externally irradiated discs at this stage. We also discuss the potential for these models as benchmarks for future photochemical-dynamical codes.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional digital image reconstruction is an important imaging process in many of the physical sciences. If the data are insufficient to specify a unique reconstruction, an additional criterion must be introduced, either implicitly or explicitly before the best estimate can be computed. Here we use a principle of maximum entropy, which has proven useful in other contexts, to design a procedure for reconstruction from noisy measurements. Implementation is described in detail for the Fourier synthesis problem of radio astronomy. The method is iterative and hence more costly than direct techniques; however, a number of comparative examples indicate that a significant improvement in image quality and resolution is possible with only a few iterations. A major component of the computational burden of the maximum entropy procedure is shown to be a two-dimensional convolution sum, which can be efficiently calculated by fast Fourier transform techniques.},

abstract = {Star formation often occurs within or nearby stellar clusters. Irradiation by nearby massive stars can photoevaporate protoplanetary disks around young stars (so-called proplyds) which raises questions regarding the ability of planet formation to take place in these environments. We investigate the two-dimensional physical and chemical structure of a protoplanetary disk surrounding a low-mass (T Tauri) star which is irradiated by a nearby massive O-type star to determine the survivability and observability of molecules in proplyds. Compared with an isolated star-disk system, the gas temperature ranges from a factor of a few (in the disk midplane) to around two orders of magnitude (in the disk surface) higher in the irradiated disk. Although the UV flux in the outer disk, in particular, is several orders of magnitude higher, the surface density of the disk is sufficient for effective shielding of the disk midplane so that the disk remains predominantly molecular in nature. We also find that non-volatile molecules, such as HCN and H2O, are able to freeze out onto dust grains in the disk midplane so that the formation of icy planetesimals, e.g., comets, may also be possible in proplyds. We have calculated the molecular line emission from the disk assuming LTE and determined that multiple transitions of atomic carbon, CO (and isotopologues, 13CO and C18O), HCO+, CN, and HCN may be observable with ALMA, allowing characterization of the gas column density, temperature, and optical depth in proplyds at the distance of Orion ({\~{}}400 pc).},

abstract = {60Fe decays to 60 Ni with a half-life of 1.49{\#}10 6 yr, so all of the original 60 Fe atoms incorporated into the solar system have decayed. Because 60 Fe is produced only in stars, its initial abundance in the solar system provides a constraint on the stellar contribution of radionuclides to the early solar system and on the nature of the stellar source. Because of its short half-life, 60 Fe is also a potential high-resolution chronometer of early-solar-system events. The presence of 60 Fe in primitive meteorites has been confirmed in sulfides, but the initial abundance of 60 Fe in the solar system has been only loosely constrained because it is uncertain when the sulfides formed. We show that 60 Fe was present with abundance ratios of 60Fe/56Fep(2.2–3.7){\#}10?7 when ferromagnesian chondrules formed.Byapplying the time difference of 1.5–2.0 million years between formation of ferromagnesian chondrules and Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), the oldest known solar system solids, a solar system initial 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio [(60 Fe/56 Fe)0 ]of(5– 10){\#}10?7 is estimated. This new solidly based (60 Fe/56 Fe)0 ratio is consistent with predictions for nucleosynthesis in a supernova or in an intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star just before the solar system formation, but is too high for the source to have been a low-mass AGB star. Considering the rarity of encounters between a molecular cloud and an AGB star, our results can be considered strong evidence of a contribution of material from a nearby supernova and of a role for a supernova in the origin of the solar system.

The primary goal of DSHARP is to find and characterize substructures in the spatial distributions of solid particles for a sample of 20 nearby protoplanetary disks, using very high resolution (0.035 arcsec, or 5 au FWHM) observations of their 240 GHz (1.25 mm) continuum emission. These data provide a first homogeneous look at the small-scale features in disks that are directly relevant to the planet formation process, quantifying their prevalence, morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry, and amplitudes, for targets with a variety of disk and stellar host properties. We find that these substructures are ubiquitous in this sample of large, bright disks. They are most frequently manifested as concentric, narrow emission rings and depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns and small arc-shaped azimuthal asymmetries are also present in some cases. These substructures are found at a wide range of disk radii (from a few au to more than 100 au), are usually compact ({\$}{\textless}{\$}10 au), and show a wide range of amplitudes (brightness contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the project, describe the survey design and the sample properties, detail the observations and data calibration, highlight some basic results, and provide a general overview of the key conclusions that are presented in more detail in a series of accompanying articles.

abstract = {(Abridged) Exoplanet atmospheres are thought be built up from accretion of gas as well as pebbles and planetesimals in the midplanes of planet-forming disks. The chemical composition of this material is usually assumed to be unchanged during the disk lifetime. However, chemistry can alter the relative abundances of molecules in this planet-building material. To assess the impact of disk chemistry during the era of planet formation, an extensive kinetic chemistry gas-grain reaction network is utilised to evolve the abundances of chemical species over time. Given a high level of ionisation, chemical evolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes becomes significant after a few times {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}5{\}}{\$} yrs, and is still ongoing by 7 Myr between the H{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}O and the O{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} icelines. Importantly, the changes in the abundances of the major elemental carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules imply that the traditional "stepfunction" for the C/O ratios in gas and ice in the disk midplane (as defined by sharp changes at icelines of H{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}O, CO{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} and CO) evolves over time, and cannot be assumed fixed. In addition, at lower temperatures ({\textless} 29 K), gaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} and other more complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} and CO thermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature than suggested by its binding energy. Chemistry in the disk midplane is ionisation-driven, and evolves over time. In order to reliably predict the atmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed atmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have formed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and implemented into planet formation models.},

In addition to being one of the largest molecules detected in disks to date, methanol is also the first disk organic molecule with an unambiguous ice chemistry origin. The stacked methanol emission, as observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, is spectrally resolved and detected across six velocity channels ( s{\textgreater}3 ), reaching a peak signal-to-noise of s5.5 , with the kinematic pattern expected for TW Hya. Using an appropriate disk model, a fractional abundance of 3 --10 4 10 ´´ 12 – 11 (with respect to H2) reproduces the stacked line profile and channel maps, with the favored abundance dependent upon the assumed vertical location (midplane versus molecular layer). The peak emission is offset from the source position, suggesting that the methanol emission has a ring-like morphology: the analysis here suggests it peaks at »30 au, reaching a column density »´ 36 1012 cm−2. In the – case of TW Hya, the larger (up to millimeter-sized) grains, residing in the inner 50 au, may thus host the bulk of the disk ice reservoir. The successful detection of cold gas-phase methanol in a protoplanetary disk implies that the products of ice chemistry can be explored in disks, opening a window into studying complex organic chemistry during planetary system formation.},

abstract = {We analyze the line radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks using several approximate methods and a well-tested accelerated Monte Carlo code. A low-mass flaring disk model with uniform as well as stratified molecular abundances is adopted. Radiative transfer in low and high rotational lines of CO, C18O, HCO+, DCO+, HCN, CS, and H2CO is simulated. The corresponding excitation temperatures, synthetic spectra, and channel maps are derived and compared to the results of the Monte Carlo calculations. A simple scheme that describes the conditions of the line excitation for a chosen molecular transition is elaborated. We find that the simple LTE approach can safely be applied for the low molecular transitions only, while it significantly overestimates the intensities of the upper lines. In contrast, the full escape probability (FEP) approximation can safely be used for the upper transitions (Jup{\textgreater}{\~{}}3), but it is not appropriate for the lowest transitions because of the maser effect. In general, the molecular lines in protoplanetary disks are partly subthermally excited and require more sophisticated approximate line radiative transfer methods. We analyze a number of approximate methods, namely, LVG, vertical escape probability (VEP), and vertical one ray (VOR) and discuss their algorithms in detail. In addition, two modifications to the canonical Monte Carlo algorithm that allow a significant speed up of the line radiative transfer modeling in rotating configurations by a factor of 10-50 are described.},

abstract = {In agreement with previous work, we show that the presence of the short-lived radionuclide Al-26 in the early Solar System was unlikely ({\textless}2{\%} a priori probability) to be the result of direct introduction of supernova ejecta into the gaseous disk during the Class II stage of protosolar evolution. We also show that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal star cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory of the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the oxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova ejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the oldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its apparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of (4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular cloud. We propose that this radionuclide originated in a prior generation of massive stars that formed in the same host molecular cloud as the Sun and contaminated that cloud by Wolf-Rayet winds. We calculated the Galactic distribution of Al-26/Al-27 ratios that arise from such contamination using the established embedded cluster mass and stellar initial mass functions, published nucleosynthetic yields from the winds of massive stars, and by assuming rapid and uniform mixing into the cloud. Although our model predicts that the majority of stellar systems contain no Al-26 from massive stars, and that the a priori probability that the Al-26/Al-27 ratio will reach or exceed the canonical Solar System value is only {\~{}}6{\%}, the maximum in the distribution of non-zero values is close to the canonical ratio.},

Herschel measurements of HD line emission imply gas masses in line with gas-to-dust mass ratios of 100. This suggests that at least one additional mechanism is removing gaseous CO. Here we test the suggestion that the bulk of the CO is chemically processed and that the carbon is sequestered into less volatile species such as CO2, CH3OH and CH4 in the dense, shielded midplane regions of the disk. Using our gas-grain chemical code we perform a parameter exploration and follow the CO abundance evolution over a range of conditions representative of shielded disk midplanes. We find that no chemical processing of CO takes place on 1-3 Myr timescales for low cosmic-ray ionisation rates, {\$}{\textless} 5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-18{\}}{\$} s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. Assuming an ionisation rate of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}}{\$} s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, more than 90{\%} of the CO is destroyed, but only in the parts of the disk below 30 K. This order of magnitude destruction of CO is robust against the choice of grain-surface reaction rate parameters except for temperatures below 20 K, where there is a strong dependence on the H tunnelling barrier. The low temperatures needed for CO chemical processing indicate that the exact disk temperature structure is important, with warm disks around luminous Herbig stars expected to have little to no CO conversion. For cold disks around T Tauri stars, a large fraction of the emitting CO layer is affected unless the disks are young ({\textless} 1 Myr). This can lead to inferred gas masses that are up to two orders of magnitude too low.},

@article{Johnstone1998,
abstract = {We present a model for the photoevaporation of circumstellar disks or dense clumps of gas by an external source of ultraviolet radiation. Our model includes the thermal and dynamic effects of 6-13.6 eV far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons and Lyman continuum EUV photons incident upon disks or clumps idealized as spheres of radius rd and enclosed mass M*. For sufficiently large values of rd/M*, the radiation field evaporates the surface gas and dust. Analytical and numerical approximations to the resulting flows are presented; the model depends on rd, M*, the flux of FUV and EUV photons, and the column density of neutral gas heated by FUV photons to high temperatures. Application of this model shows that the circumstellar disks (rd {\~{}} 1014-1015 cm) in the Orion Nebula ("proplyds") are rapidly destroyed by the external UV radiation field. Close (d {\textless}{\~{}} 1017 cm) to theta 1 Ori C, the ionizing EUV photon flux controls the mass-loss rate, and the ionization front (IF) is approximately coincident with the disk surface. Gas evaporated from the cold disk moves subsonically through a relatively thin photodissociation region (PDR) dominated by FUV photons and heated to {\~{}}1000 K. As the distance from theta 1 Ori C increases, the Lyman continuum flux declines, the PDR thickens, and the IF moves away from the disk surface. At d {\~{}} 3 x 1017 cm, the thickness of the PDR becomes comparable to the disk radius. Between 3 x 1017 cm {\textless}{\~{}} d {\textless}{\~{}} 1018 cm, spherical divergence and the resultant pressure gradient in the 103 K PDR forms a mildly supersonic ({\~{}}3-6 km s-1) but neutral Parker wind. This wind flows outward until it passes through a shock, beyond which gas moves subsonically through a stationary D-type IF. The IF is moved away from the disk surface to a standoff distance rIF {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2.5rd. In this regime, the mass-loss rate is determined by the incident FUV photon flux and not the ionizing flux. However, at very large distances, d {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1018 cm, the FUV photon flux drops to values that cannot maintain the disk surface temperature at {\~{}}103 K. As the PDR temperature drops, the pressure of the FUV-powered flow declines with increasing distance from theta 1 Ori C, and again the EUV ionizing photons can penetrate close to the disk surface and dominate the evaporation rate. Radio, H alpha , and [O III] observations of externally illuminated young stellar objects in the Trapezium region are used to determine rIF and the projected distances, d⊥, from theta 1 Ori C. The observed values of rIF and d⊥ are combined with the theory to estimate the disk sizes, mass-loss rates, surface densities, and disk masses for the ensemble of extended sources in the Trapezium cluster. Observations of rIF, d⊥, and rd in HST 182-413 and a few other sources are used to calibrate parameters of the theory, especially the column of heated PDR gas. The disks have a range in sizes between 14 {\textless} log [rd/(cm)] {\textless} 15.2, mass-loss rates of -7.7 {\textless} log [M dot /(Msolar/{\{}yr{\}})]{\textless}-6.2 , surface densities at disk edge 0.7 {\textless} log [ Sigma (rd)/(g cm-2)] {\textless} 2.5 which imply disk surface densities at 1 AU from the central, embedded star of 2.8 {\textless} log [ Sigma 0/(g cm-2)] {\textless} 3.8 and disk masses of 0.002 {\textless} Md/Mȯ {\textless} 0.07. Sigma and Md scale with the adopted ionization time, ti, which we take to be 105 yr. The inferred Sigma (rd) for the ensemble of disks suggest that the initial surface density power law of an individual disk, Sigma {\~{}} r- alpha , is bounded by 1 {\textless}{\~{}} alpha {\textless}{\~{}} 1.5.},

abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of Jupiter are presented. The formation model assumes that first a solid core of several M⊕ accretes from the planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk, and then the core captures a massive gaseous envelope from the protoplanetary disk. Earlier studies of the core accretion-gas capture model [Pollack, J.B., Hubickyj, O., Bodenheimer, P., Lissauer, J.J., Podolak, M., Greenzweig, Y., 1996. Icarus 124, 62-85] demonstrated that it was possible for Jupiter to accrete with a solid core of 10-30 M⊕ in a total formation time comparable to the observed lifetime of protoplanetary disks. Recent interior models of Jupiter and Saturn that agree with all observational constraints suggest that Jupiter's core mass is 0-11 M⊕ and Saturn's is 9-22 M⊕ [Saumon, G., Guillot, T., 2004. Astrophys. J. 609, 1170-1180]. We have computed simulations of the growth of Jupiter using various values for the opacity produced by grains in the protoplanet's atmosphere and for the initial planetesimal surface density, $\sigma$init,Z, in the protoplanetary disk. We also explore the implications of halting the solid accretion at selected core mass values during the protoplanet's growth. Halting planetesimal accretion at low core mass simulates the presence of a competing embryo, and decreasing the atmospheric opacity due to grains emulates the settling and coagulation of grains within the protoplanet's atmosphere. We examine the effects of adjusting these parameters to determine whether or not gas runaway can occur for small mass cores on a reasonable timescale. We compute four series of simulations with the latest version of our code, which contains updated equation of state and opacity tables as well as other improvements. Each series consists of a run without a cutoff in planetesimal accretion, plus up to three runs with a cutoff at a particular core mass. The first series of runs is computed with an atmospheric opacity due to grains (hereafter referred to as 'grain opacity') that is 2{\%} of the interstellar value and $\sigma$init,Z = 10 g/cm2. Cutoff runs are computed for core masses of 10, 5, and 3 M⊕. The second series of Jupiter models is computed with the grain opacity at the full interstellar value and $\sigma$init,Z = 10 g/cm2. Cutoff runs are computed for core masses of 10 and 5 M⊕. The third series of runs is computed with the grain opacity at 2{\%} of the interstellar value and $\sigma$init,Z = 6 g/cm2. One cutoff run is computed with a core mass of 5 M⊕. The final series consists of one run, without a cutoff, which is computed with a temperature dependent grain opacity (i.e., 2{\%} of the interstellar value for T {\textless} 350 K ramping up to the full interstellar value for T {\textgreater} 500 K) and $\sigma$init,Z = 10 g/cm2. Our results demonstrate that reducing grain opacities results in formation times less than half of those for models computed with full interstellar grain opacity values. The reduction of opacity due to grains in the upper portion of the envelope with T ≤ 500 K has the largest effect on the lowering of the formation time. If the accretion of planetesimals is not cut off prior to the accretion of gas, then decreasing the surface density of planetesimals lowers the final core mass of the protoplanet, but increases the formation timescale considerably. Finally, a core mass cutoff results in a reduction of the time needed for a protoplanet to evolve to the stage of runaway gas accretion, provided the cutoff mass is sufficiently large. The overall results indicate that, with reasonable parameters, it is possible that Jupiter formed at 5 AU via the core accretion process in 1 Myr with a core of 10 M⊕ or in 5 Myr with a core of 5 M⊕.},

abstract = {The chemical properties of protoplanetary disks are especially sensitive to their ionization environment. Sources of molecular gas ionization include cosmic rays, stellar X-rays and short-lived radionuclides, each of which varies with location in the disk. This behavior leads to a significant amount of chemical structure, especially in molecular ion abundances, which is imprinted in their submillimeter rotational line emission. Using an observationally motivated disk model, we make predictions for the dependence of chemical abundances on the assumed properties of the ionizing field. We calculate the emergent line intensity for abundant molecular ions and simulate sensitive observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) for a disk at D=100 pc. The models readily distinguish between high ionization rates ({\$}\backslashzeta\backslashgtrsim10{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}}{\$} s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} per H{\$}{\_}2{\$}) and below, but it becomes difficult to distinguish between low ionization models when {\$}\backslashzeta\backslashlesssim10{\^{}}{\{}-19{\}}{\$} s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {Jupiter and Saturn formed in a few million years (Haisch et al. 2001) from a gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration of their orbits on timescales of only {\~{}}100,000 years (Armitage 2007). Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration (Masset {\&} Snellgrove 2001, Morbidelli {\&} Crida 2007, Pierens {\&} Nelson 2008). The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later (Klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (Wetherill 1978, Hansen 2009) (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.},

We present a study of the distribution of stellar ages in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) based on accurate HST photometry taken from the HST Treasury Program observations of the ONC utilizing the most recent estimate of the cluster's distance (Menten et al. 2007). We investigate the presence of an intrinsic age spread in the region and a possible trend of age with the spatial distribution. Methods. We estimate the extinction and accretion luminosity towards each source by performing synthetic photometry on an empirical calibration of atmospheric models (Da Rio et al. 2010) using the package Chorizos (Maiz-Apellaniz 2004). The position of the sources in the HR-diagram is compared with different theoretical isochrones to estimate the mean cluster age and age dispersion. Through Monte Carlo simulations we quantify the amount of intrinsic age spread in the region, taking into account uncertainties on the distance, spectral type, extinction, unresolved binaries, accretion and photometric variability. Results. According to Siess et al. (2000) evolutionary models the mean age of the Cluster is 2.2 Myr with a scatter of few Myrs. With Monte Carlo simulations we find that the observed age spread is inconsistent with a coeval stellar population, but is in agreement with a star formation activity between 1.5 and 3.5 Myrs. We also observe light evidence for a trend of ages with spatial distribution.},

These were detected as part of our H$\alpha$ survey of Orion with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Several of the disks show bipolar reflection nebulae, microjets, or pronounced temporal variability of their central stars. The relatively large fraction of bipolar reflection nebulae and microjets in our sample may be a selection effect caused by the faint nebular background far from the Trapezium. Two disks in our sample are large and particularly noteworthy: A nearly edge-on disk, d216-0939, is located several arcminutes northwest of M43 and resembles the famous HH 30 disk/jet system in Taurus. It drives the 0.15 pc long bipolar outflow HH 667 and exhibits a remarkable asymmetric reflection nebula caused by the tilt of the flared disk. With a diameter of {\~{}}2.6" (1200 AU), d216-0939 is as large as the giant edge-on silhouette disk d114-426 in the core of the Orion Nebula. The large disk d253-1536 is located in a binary system embedded within an externally ionized giant proplyd in M43. The disk exhibits distortions that we attribute to tidal interactions with the companion star. The bipolar jet HH 668 emerges from the proplyd ionization front in a direction orthogonal to the disk and can be traced to the young star embedded within it. A bow shock lies 54" south of this binary system along the outflow axis. Proper motions over a 1.4 yr baseline confirm that these emission knots are indeed moving away from d253-1536 with speeds as high as {\~{}}330 km s-1 in the HH 668 microjet and slower motion farther from the star.

abstract = {The structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks, especially the radial flows of gas through them, are sensitive to a number of factors. One that has been considered only occasionally in the literature is external photoevaporation by far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from nearby, massive stars, despite the fact that nearly half of disks will experience photoevaporation. Another effect apparently not considered in the literature is a spatially and temporally varying value of $\alpha$ in the disk (where the turbulent viscosity $\nu$ is $\alpha$ times the sound speed C times the disk scale height H). Here we use the formulation of Bai {\&} Stone to relate $\alpha$ to the ionization fraction in the disk, assuming turbulent transport of angular momentum is due to the magnetorotational instability. We calculate the ionization fraction of the disk gas under various assumptions about ionization sources and dust grain properties. Disk evolution is most sensitive to the surface area of dust. We find that typically $\alpha$???10−5 in the inner disk ({\textless}2AU), rising to ∼10−1 beyond 20 AU. This drastically alters the structure of the disk and the flow of mass through it: while the outer disk rapidly viscously spreads, the inner disk hardly evolves; this leads to a steep surface density profile ( Sµ r p- with p{\'{a}} {\~{n}}?≈?2–5 in the 5–30AU region) that is made steeper by external photoevaporation. We also find that the combination of variable $\alpha$ and external photoevaporation eventually causes gas as close as 3 AU, previously accreting inward, to be drawn outward to the photoevaporated outer edge of the disk. These effects have drastic consequences for planet formation and volatile transport in protoplanetary disks.},

Methods: We used high-resolution and high-sensitivity ALMA observations of the CO(3-2) emission line and the continuum at 850 $\mu$m, as well as the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MCFOST, to model the data presented in this work. Results: The CO(3-2) emission unveils for the first time at submillimeter frequencies the vertical structure details of a gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation, showing the back and front sides of a flared disk. Continuum emission at 850 $\mu$m reveals a compact dust disk with a 240 AU outer radius and a surface brightness profile that shows a very steep decline at radius larger than 125 AU. The gaseous disk is more than two times larger than the dust disk, with a similar critical radius but with a shallower radial profile. Radiative transfer models of the continuum data confirm the need for a sharp outer edge to the dust disk. The models for the CO(3-2) channel map require the disk to be slightly more geometrically thick than previous models suggested, and that the temperature at which CO gas becomes depleted (i.e., frozen out) from the outer regions of the disk midplane is T {\textless} 20 K, in agreement with previous studies.},

abstract = {CO is widely used as a tracer of molecular gas. However, there is now mounting evidence that gas phase carbon is depleted in the disk around TW Hya. Previous efforts to quantify this depletion have been hampered by uncertainties regarding the radial thermal structure in the disk. Here we present resolved ALMA observations of 13CO 3-2, C18O 3-2, 13CO 6-5, and C18O 6-5 emission in TW Hya, which allow us to derive radial gas temperature and gas surface density profiles, as well as map the CO abundance as a function of radius. These observations provide a measurement of the surface CO snowline at {\~{}}30 AU and show evidence for an outer ring of CO emission centered at 53 AU, a feature previously seen only in less abundant species. Further, the derived CO gas temperature profile constrains the freeze-out temperature of CO in the warm molecular layer to {\textless} 21 K. Combined with the previous detection of HD 1-0, these data constrain the surface density of the warm H2 gas in the inner {\~{}}30 AU. We find that CO is depleted by two orders of magnitude from R=10-60 AU, with the small amount of CO returning to the gas phase inside the surface CO snowline insufficient to explain the overall depletion. Finally, this new data is used in conjunction with previous modeling of the TW Hya disk to constrain the midplane CO snowline to 17-23 AU.},

The measured fluxes were combined with data in the submillimeter to derive the millimeter spectral index of each individual disk component. We show how these observations can be used to test the models of dust evolution and early growth of solids in protoplanetary disks. Our analysis indicates that the disk with lower density and higher temperature hosts larger grains than the companion disk. This result is the opposite of what is predicted by the dust evolution models. The models and observational results can be reconciled if the viscosity $\alpha$-parameter differs by more than a factor of 10 in the two disks, or if the distribution of solids in the disks is strongly affected by radial motions. This analysis can be applied to future high angular resolution observations of young disks with EVLA and ALMA to provide even stronger observational constraints to the models of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.},

abstract = {We present spatially and spectrally resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of gas and dust in the disk orbiting the pre-main sequence (pre-MS) binary AK Sco. By forward-modeling the disk velocity field traced by CO J = 2–1 line emission, we infer the mass of the central binary, M* 2.49 0.10=? M?, a new dynamical measurement that is independent of stellar evolutionary models. Assuming the disk and binary are co-planar within ∼2°, this disk-based binary mass measurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocity monitoring of the combined stellar spectra. These ALMA results are also compared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location of the binary in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, using several common pre-MS model grids. These models predict stellar masses that are marginally consistent with our dynamical measurement (at ∼2$\sigma$), but are systematically high (by ∼10{\%}). These same models consistently predict an age of 18 ± 1 Myr for AK Sco, in line with its membership in the Upper Centaurus–Lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host a gas-rich disk. As ALMA accumulates comparable data for large samples of pre- MS stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamical mass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful for efforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.},

abstract = {Circumstellar disks provide the reservoirs of raw material and determine conditions for the formation of nascent planetary systems. This thesis presents observations from millimeter-wavelength interferometers, particularly the Submillimeter Array, that address the following outstanding problems in the study of protoplanetary disks: (1) constraining the physical mechanisms driving the viscous transport of material through the disk, and (2) carrying out detailed studies of “transitional” objects between the gas-rich protoplanetary and tenuous, dusty debris disk phases to better understand how gas and dust are cleared from the system. We study accretion processes in three complementary ways: using spatially resolved observations of molecular gas lines at high spectral resolution to determine the magnitude and spatial distribution of turbulence in the disk; using polarimetry to constrain the magnetic properties of the outer disk in order to evaluate whether the MRI is a plausible origin for this turbulence; and investigating the gas and dust distribution at the outer disk edge in the context of self-similar models of accretion disk structure and evolution. The studies of transition disks use spatially resolved observations to study the detailed structure of the gas and dust in systems that are currently in the process of clearing material. We obtain snapshots of the inside-out clearing of gas and dust in several systems, and compare our observations with the theoretical predictions generated for different disk clearing mechanisms. Our observations are generally consistent with the characteristics predicted for viscous transport driven by the magnetorotational instability and disk clearing accomplished through the dual action of giant planet formation and photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the star.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that the observed systems of hot super-Earths formed in situ from high-mass discs. By fitting a disc profile to the entire population of Kepler planet candidates, Chiang {\&} Laughlin constructed a `minimum-mass extrasolar nebula' with surface density profile $\Sigma$ ∝ r-1.6. Here, we use multiple-planet systems to show that it is inconsistent to assume a universal disc profile. Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet candidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass discs with surface density profiles ranging from $\Sigma$ ∝ r-3.2 to $\Sigma$ ∝ r0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By simulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems designed to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that a universal disc profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. Rather, the underlying distribution of minimum-mass discs is characterized by a broad range of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous discs can only explain a narrow range of slopes (roughly between r0 and r-1.5). Yet accretion of terrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radial distribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths must therefore not represent the structure of their parent gas discs and cannot have predominantly formed in situ. We instead interpret the diversity of disc slopes as the imprint of a process that re-arranged the solids relative to the gas in the inner parts of protoplanetary discs. A plausible mechanism is inward type 1 migration of Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryos, perhaps followed by a final assembly phase. L6},

abstract = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation -- turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity -- are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

abstract = {The evolution of discs under the action of viscosity is studied by both simi- larity solutions and Green's functions. The angular momentum is steadily concentrated onto a small fraction of the mass which orbits at greater and greater radii while the rest is accreted onto the central body. We assume that the angular momentum excess of a proto-star is initially concentrated onto one-third of the total mass which forms a disc orbiting the new-born star. Viscous dissipation in this disc will cause it to shine with a luminosity greater than the final main sequence star for a period of 105 yr or so. Most of the properties of T Tauri stars can be explained as a consequence of disc evolution. Flares in Flare stars are interpreted as the entry of blobs of an old disc into the late type stellar atmospheres. On this hypothesis flaring activity could be observed in M stars of up to 5 x 108 yr old, and planetary systems will be common. Disc solutions appropriate to dwarf novae and X-ray sources are also given.},

abstract = {An era has started in which gas and dust can be observed independently in protoplanetary disks, thanks to the recent surveys with ALMA. The first near-complete high-resolution disk survey in both dust and gas in a single star-forming region has been carried out in Lupus, finding surprisingly low gas/dust ratios. The goal of this work is to fully exploit CO isotopologues observations in Lupus, comparing them with physical-chemical model results, in order to obtain gas masses for a large number of disks. We have employed physical-chemical models to analyze continuum and CO isotopologues observations of Lupus disks, including isotope-selective processes and freeze-out. Employing also the ALMA 13CO-only detections, disk gas masses have been calculated for a total of 34 sources, expanding the sample of 10 disks studied by Ansdell et al. (2016), where also C18O was detected. We confirm that overall gas-masses are very low, often smaller than 1 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm J{\}}{\$}, if volatile carbon is not depleted. Accordingly, global gas/dust ratios predominantly between 1 and 10. Low CO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios may indicate rapid loss of gas, or alternatively chemical evolution, e.g. via sequestering of carbon from CO to more complex molecules, or carbon locked up in larger bodies. Current ALMA observations cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses. We have simulated both scenarios, but chemical model results do not allow us to rule out one of the two. Assuming that all Lupus disks have evolved mainly due to viscous processes over the past few Myr, the observed correlation between the current mass accretion rate and dust mass found by Manara et al. (2016) implies a constant gas-to-dust ratio, which is close to 100 based on the observed {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm disk{\}}/\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm acc{\}}{\$} ratio. This in turn points to a scenario in which carbon depletion is responsible for the low CO isotopologue line luminosities.},

abstract = {We present results from a model of the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks. In our models we directly calculate the changing propagation and penetration of a high energy radiation field with Lyman alpha radiation included. We also explore the effect on our models of including dust grain settling. We find that, in agreement with earlier studies, the evolution of dust grains plays a large role in determining how deep the UV radiation penetrates into the disk. Significant grain settling at the midplane leads to much smaller freeze-out regions and a correspondingly larger molecular layer, which leads to an increase in column density for molecular species such as CO, CN and SO. The inclusion of Lyman alpha radiation impacts the disk chemistry through specific species that have large photodissociation cross sections at 1216 A. These include HCN, NH3 and CH4, for which the column densities are decreased by an order of magnitude or more due to the presence of Lyman alpha radiation in the UV spectrum. A few species, such as CO2 and SO, are enhanced by the presence of Lyman alpha radiation, but rarely by more than a factor of a few.},

abstract = {We have developed a high resolution combined physical and chemical model of a protoplanetary disk surrounding a typical T Tauri star. Our aims were to use our model to calculate the chemical structure of disks on small scales (sub-milli-arcsecond in the inner disk for objects at the distance of Taurus, {\~{}} 140 pc) to investigate the various chemical processes thought to be important in disks and to determine potential molecular tracers of each process. Our gas-phase network was extracted from the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry to which we added gas-grain interactions including freeze out and thermal and non-thermal desorption (cosmic-ray induced desorption, photodesorption and X-ray desorption) and a grain-surface network. We find that cosmic-ray induced desorption has the least effect on our disk chemical structure while photodesorption has a significant effect, enhancing the abundances of most gas-phase molecules throughout the disk and affecting the abundances and distribution of HCN, CN and CS, in particular. In the outer disk, we also see enhancements in the abundances of H2O and CO2. X-ray desorption is a potentially powerful mechanism in disks, acting to homogenise the fractional abundances of gas-phase species across the depth and increasing the column densities of most molecules although there remain significant uncertainties in the rates adopted for this process. The addition of grain-surface chemistry enhances the fractional abundances of several small complex organic molecules including CH3OH, HCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3 to potentially observable values (i.e. a fractional abundance of {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1.0E-11).},

Those around main sequence stars are analogous to the Solar System's Kuiper Belt and Zodiacal light.

Observations of debris disks provide insight into the evolution of planetary systems; the composition of dust, comets, and planetesimals outside the Solar System; as well as placing constraints on the orbital architecture and potentially the masses of exoplanets that are not otherwise detectable. This review highlights recent advances in multiwavelength, high-resolution scattered light and thermal imaging that have revealed a complex and intricate diversity of structures in debris disks, and discusses how modeling methods are evolving with the breadth and depth of the available observations. Two rapidly advancing subfields highlighted in this review include observations of atomic and molecular gas around main sequence stars, and variations in emission from debris disks on very short (days to years) timescales, providing evidence of non-steady state collisional evolution particularly in young debris disks.},

We are able to place stringent upper limits ({\$}v{\_}{\{}\backslashrm turb{\}}{\textless}{\$}0.06c{\$}{\_}s{\$}, {\$}{\textless}{\$}0.05c{\$}{\_}s{\$} and {\$}{\textless}{\$}0.04c{\$}{\_}s{\$} for CO(2-1), C{\$}{\^{}}{\{}18{\}}{\$}O(2-1) and DCO{\$}{\^{}}+{\$}(3-2) respectively), corresponding to {\$}\backslashalpha\backslashlesssim{\$}3{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, similar to our prior limit derived from CO(3-2). This indicates that there is little turbulence throughout the vertical extent of the disk, contrary to theoretical predictions based on the magneto-rotational instability and gravito-turbulence. In modeling the DCO{\$}{\^{}}+{\$} emission we also find that it is confined to three concentric rings at 65.7{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.9 au, 149.9{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+0.5{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.7{\}}{\$} au and 259{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1 au, indicative of a complex chemical environment.},

@article{Mann2015,
abstract = {We present the results from a Submillimeter Array survey of the 887 micron continuum emission from the protoplanetary disks around 95 young stars in the young cluster NGC 2024. Emission was detected from 22 infrared sources, with flux densities from {\~{}}5 to 330 mJy; upper limits (at 3sigma) for the other 73 sources range from 3 to 24 mJy. For standard assumptions, the corresponding disk masses range from {\~{}}0.003 to 0.2Msolar, with upper limits at 0.002--0.01Msolar. The NGC 2024 sample has a slightly more populated tail at the high end of its disk mass distribution compared to other clusters, but without more information on the nature of the sample hosts it remains unclear if this difference is statistically significant or a superficial selection effect. Unlike in the Orion Trapezium, there is no evidence for a disk mass dependence on the (projected) separation from the massive star IRS2b in the NGC 2024 cluster. We suggest that this is due to either the cluster youth or a comparatively weaker photoionizing radiation field.},

@article{Bontemps2001,
abstract = {We present the results of the first extensive mid-infrared (IR) imaging survey of the rho Ophiuchi embedded cluster, performed with the ISOCAM camera on board the ISO satellite. The main molecular cloud L1688, as well as L1689N and L1689S, have been completely surveyed for point sources at 6.7 and 14.3 micron. A total of 425 sources are detected including 16 Class I, 123 Class II, and 77 Class III young stellar objects (YSOs). Essentially all of the mid-IR sources coincide with near-IR sources, but a large proportion of them are recognized for the first time as YSOs. Our dual-wavelength survey allows us to identify essentially all the YSOs with IR excess in the embedded cluster down to Fnu {\~{}} 10 - 15 mJy. It more than doubles the known population of Class II YSOs and represents the most complete census to date of newly formed stars in the rho Ophiuchi central region. The stellar luminosity function of the complete sample of Class II YSOs is derived with a good accuracy down to L= 0.03 Lsun. A modeling of this lumino- sity function, using available pre-main sequence tracks and plausible star for- mation histories, allows us to derive the mass distribution of the Class II YSOs which arguably reflects the IMF of the embedded cluster. We estimate that the IMF in rho Ophiuchi is well described by a two-component power law with a low- mass index of -0.35+/-0.25, a high-mass index of -1.7 (to be compared with the Salpeter value of -1.35), and a break occurring at M = 0.55+/-0.25 Msun. This IMF is flat with no evidence for a low-mass cutoff down to at least 0.06 Msun.},

@article{Andrews2009,
abstract = {We present a high angular resolution (0.3" = 40 AU) SMA survey of the 870 micron thermal continuum emission from 9 of the brightest, and therefore most massive, circumstellar disks in the {\~{}}1 Myr-old Ophiuchus star-forming region. Using 2-D radiative transfer calculations, we simultaneously fit the observed continuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk with a parametric structure model. Compared to previous millimeter studies, this survey includes significant upgrades in modeling, data quality, and angular resolution that provide improved constraints on key structure parameters, particularly those that characterize the spatial distribution of mass in the disks. In the context of a surface density profile motivated by similarity solutions for viscous accretion disks, the best-fit models for the sample disks have characteristic radii R{\_}c = 20-200 AU, high disk masses M{\_}d = 0.005-0.14 M{\_}sun, and a narrow range of radial surface density gradients around a median {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} = 0.9. These density structures are used in conjunction with accretion rate estimates from the literature to help characterize the viscous evolution of the disk material. Using the standard prescription for disk viscosities, those combined constraints indicate that {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} = 0.0005-0.08. Three of the sample disks show large (R = 20-40 AU) central cavities in their continuum emission morphologies, marking extensive zones where dust has been physically removed and/or has significantly diminished opacities. Based on the current requirements of planet formation models, these emission cavities and the structure constraints for the sample as a whole suggest that these young disks may eventually produce planetary systems, and have perhaps already started.

abstract = {Planetary formation theories suggest that the giant planets formed on circular and coplanar orbits. The eccentricities of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, however, reach values of 6 per cent, 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of approximately 2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals. Our model reproduces all the important characteristics of the giant planets' orbits, namely their final semimajor axes, eccentricities and mutual inclinations.},

abstract = {We report Submillimeter Array observations of CO (J = 2-1, 3-2, and 6-5) and its isotopologues (13CO J = 2-1, C18O J = 2-1, and C17O J = 3-2) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 at {\~{}}2'' (250 AU) resolution, and interpret these data in the framework of a model that constrains the radial and vertical location of the line emission regions. First, we develop a physically self-consistent accretion disk model with an exponentially tapered edge that matches the spectral energy distribution and spatially resolved millimeter dust continuum emission. Then, we refine the vertical structure of the model using wide range of excitation conditions sampled by the CO lines, in particular the rarely observed J = 6-5 transition. By fitting 13CO data in this structure, we further constrain the vertical distribution of CO to lie between a lower boundary below which CO freezes out onto dust grains (T 19 K) and an upper boundary above which CO can be photodissociated (the hydrogen column density from the disk surface is 1021 cm–2). The freezeout at 19 K leads to a significant drop in the gas-phase CO column density beyond a radius of {\~{}}155 AU, a CO snow line that we directly resolve. By fitting the abundances of all CO isotopologues, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C, 16O/18O, and 18O/17O that are consistent with quiescent interstellar gas-phase values. This detailed model of the HD 163296 disk demonstrates the potential of a staged, parametric technique for constructing unified gas and dust structure models and constraining the distribution of molecular abundances using resolved multi-transition, multi-isotope observations.},
