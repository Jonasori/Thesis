($a$): There is a clear upper limit on pair flux that is correlated to projected separation (green, red, and blue marks represent close, medium, and wide pairs). the presence of a circumbinary disk (magenta) yields an extra source of flux, and so pairs featuring such a disk do not follow the separation-limited flux pattern.

($a$): Both disks in binary pairs are systematically less massive than single (isolated) disks although, as expected, the primary has more representation at the more massive end. ($b$): Close pairs are more significantly truncated than wide pairs, although wide pairs are still under-massive as well. ($c$) Close pairs do not preferentially truncate either disk; each has a sharp upper limit.
