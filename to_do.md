## TO DO

* Position-velocity diagram
* Moment-map plots
* Another go at the emcee sticking point.


Meredith Questions:
- Am I doing LAS right/m -> klam conversion right?
- What kind of weighting am I using in ICR? I think in tools i'm using robust=2 (!= natural, right?)
- Miriad article (Sault et al 1995) download somewhere? Can't find it.
- How to get integrated line flux: cgcurs (in miriad): options = stats (maybe) (maybe around 2 sigma)


Remove low-signal channels before making the moment1 summation (clip, threshold in CASA or miriad) IMPORTANT (for m1)
