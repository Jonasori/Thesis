## TO DO

* Position-velocity diagram
* Moment-map plots



Meredith Questions:
- Am I doing LAS right/m -> klam conversion right?
- What kind of weighting am I using in ICR? I think in tools i'm using robust=2 (!= natural, right?)
- Miriad article (Sault et al 1995) download somewhere? Can't find it.
