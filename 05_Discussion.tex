\section{Planet-Forming Potential}
\label{section:fitting_procedure}

In order to gauage a disk's planet forming potential, we may begin by referring to the MMSN

One way to contextualize the results presented in \S\ref{chap:analysis} is through the lens of planet formation. This analysis traditionally begins with a comparison to the MMSN, which is the density profile that our own Solar System would have if all our planets had gas added to them until their composition matched that of the Sun, then each planet's mass was spread out in a ring along its orbital path (as discussed in \S\ref{chap:introduction}). Integrating this mass leaves us with $M_\text{MMSN} \approx 0.01 M_\odot$. It is worth reiterating that this is an extremely rough metric, build on several assumptions, and that it does not reflect \textit{minimum} mass of a planet forming potential, but rather an approximation of the mass it would take for a disk like ours to form.

With the extremely large mass of $M = 0.36M_\odot$ that we measure in the CO line, it is needless to say that the disk's mass would not be its limiting factor in planet formation.


Because we did not fit for the surface density profile index, instead option to leave it fixed at $\gamma=1$ \citep{Andrews2009},
