I have been blessed with an intense and intensely unexpected journey through Wesleyan. When I marked down ``studio art" as my intended major on my ED Common Application to Wesleyan back in the fall of 2013, I had absolutely no idea that, more than half a decade later, I would be finishing a masters degree in astronomy with a physics undergrad degree under my belt. It goes without saying that making that transition was one that I absolutely could not have survived without the support of an incredible network of friends, family, and mentors.

I suppose it is appropriate to first acknowledge the immense role that Dr. Donald Griswold, my high school physics teacher and mentor, has had on my life trajectory and how I see the world. It was through his deep dedication to teaching and sharing that I was lucky enough to even consider taking a physics class when I got to Wesleyan, but it is also through his mentorship that I learned to contextualize what matters in life, what is worth pursuing, and what is real. It was also his voice that, to this day and hopefully for the rest of my days, rings in my head when I get too full of myself, reminding me of the absolute power of humility. His guidance in a time of life transitions has had an immense effect on me, and for that I am deeply grateful.


It does, of course, take a great deal more than inspiration to actually push yourself to do something that is wildly uncomfortable
