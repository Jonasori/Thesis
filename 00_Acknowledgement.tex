Thanks to Wesleyan's Astronomy Department for providing me with a home where I could explore and pursue my passion. I am grateful to Prof. Seth Redfield for helping me to find the spirit of an exoplanteer within myself. Thanks for leaving your door open for any discussions, and letting me bother you with all sort of questions bubbling in my head. I am also thankful to P. Wilson Cauley and Girish Duvvuri, both of whom helped me getting started in the early days of my research. And I cannot help thanking Markov Chain Monte Carlo maestro Kevin Flaherty, not only for his help with MCMC but also with any questions related to planetary science and disks forming planets. Also, Ismael Mireles deserves a special thanks for his work to improve our existing pipeline. And I also want to thank Ryan Adler-Levine for his discussions on the Trojan objects. Prof. Roy Kilgard should get the sincerest apologies and thank you, for it was him who I bothered when there were computer and network issues.

In the course of my research, I got a chance to collaborate with \texttt{KESPRINT}, an exoplanet group bringing experts from different continents. The discovery paper and subsequent analysis of the GJ 9827 system presented in this thesis would not have been possible without such opportunities. I am particularly thankful to Prof. Davide Gandolfi from University of Torino, Italy for his role in making this collaboration effort work.

And special thanks goes to to Evan Carter, with whom I shared the office for two years. His cheerfulness lightened the whole basement, if not the whole astronomy department. Thanks to Sophia Flury for making those coffee runs to the graduate student office. Also thanks to Zach Lambros, Cail Daley, Kristen Luchsinger, Simon Wright, Avi Stein, Gloria Fonseca, Rachel Aronow, Julian Dann, Jessica Klusmeyer, Julia Zachary, Hunter Vannier, Michel Henderson, Terra Ganey and Jonas Powell for making the basement the best place to be. Also thanks to friends from Earth and Environmental Scic department Melissa Luna, Reid Perkins, and John Hossain for making Wesleyan a more holistic experience. I am glad that our paths crossed, and hope they cross again in the future.

Additionally, I want to thanks my parents who have shared the ups and downs of my research, and patiently heard my complaints when things did not work. Their moral support has been very crucial in bringing this work to a conclusion. And lastly, I must also thanks \ketu team at NASA, who made \ketu such a successful mission and thereby has made a lot of research, including this work, possible.
