	abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of molecular line emission from d216-0939, one of the largest and most massive protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We model the spectrally resolved HCO+ (4–3), CO (3–2), and HCN (4–3) lines observed at 0. 5 resolution to ﬁt the temperature and density structure of the disk. We also weakly detect and spectrally resolve the CS (7–6) line but do not model it. The abundances we derive for CO and HCO+ are generally consistent with expected values from chemical modeling of protoplanetary disks, while the HCN abundance is higher than expected. We dynamically measure the mass of the central star to be 2.17 ± 0.07 M which is inconsistent with the previously determined spectral type of K5. We also report the detection of a spatially unresolved high-velocity blue-shifted excess emission feature with a measurable positional oﬀset from the central star, consistent with a Keplerian orbit at 60 ± 20 au. Using the integrated ﬂux of the feature in HCO+ (4–3), we estimate the total H2 gas mass of this feature to be at least 1.8 − 8 MJupiter, depending on the assumed temperature. The feature is due to a local temperature and/or density enhancement consistent with either a hydrodynamic vortex or the expected signature of the envelope of a forming protoplanet within the disk.},

	abstract = {We present ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks (“proplyds”) in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We imaged 5 individual ﬁelds at 856 µm containing 22 HST-identiﬁed proplyds and detected 21 of them. Eight of those disks were detected for the ﬁrst time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the most prominent, well-known proplyd in the entire Orion Nebula, 114-426. Thermal dust emission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one of the detected disks, and ranged between 1–163 mJy, with resulting disk masses of 0.3 − 79 Mjup. An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 ﬁelds, but only 2 were detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include OB stars, θ1 Ori C and θ1 Ori F, range from 0.1–0.6 Mjup. Combining these ALMA data with previous SMA observations, we ﬁnd a lack of massive ( 3 Mjup) disks in the extreme-UV dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of θ1 Ori C. At larger separations from θ1 Ori C, in the far-UV dominated region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in the extreme-UV dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the far-UV dominated regions relatively unaﬀected.},

The measured ﬂuxes were combined with data in the submillimeter to derive the millimeter spectral index of each individual disk component. We show how these observations can be used to test the models of dust evolution and early growth of solids in protoplanetary disks. Our analysis indicates that the disk with lower density and higher temperature hosts larger grains than the companion disk. This result is the opposite of what is predicted by the dust evolution models. The models and observational results can be reconciled if the viscosity α-parameter differs by more than a factor of 10 in the two disks, or if the distribution of solids in the disks is strongly affected by radial motions. This analysis can be applied to future high angular resolution observations of young disks with EVLA and ALMA to provide even stronger observational constraints to the models of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks.},

These were detected as part of our H  survey of Orion with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Several of the disks show bipolar reﬂection nebulae, microjets, or pronounced temporal variability of their central stars. The relatively large fraction of bipolar reﬂection nebulae and microjets in our sample may be a selection effect caused by the faint nebular background far from the Trapezium. Two disks in our sample are large and particularly noteworthy: A nearly edge-on disk, d216À0939, is located several arcminutes northwest of M43 and resembles the famous HH 30 disk/jet system in Taurus. It drives the 0.15 pc long bipolar outﬂow HH 667 and exhibits a remarkable asymmetric reﬂection nebula caused by the tilt of the ﬂared disk. With a diameter of \$2B6 (1200 AU ), d216À0939 is as large as the giant edge-on silhouette disk d114À426 in the core of the Orion Nebula. The large disk d253À1536 is located in a binary system embedded within an externally ionized giant proplyd in M43. The disk exhibits distortions that we attribute to tidal interactions with the companion star. The bipolar jet HH 668 emerges from the proplyd ionization front in a direction orthogonal to the disk and can be traced to the young star embedded within it. A bow shock lies 5400 south of this binary system along the outﬂow axis. Proper motions over a 1.4 yr baseline conﬁrm that these emission knots are indeed moving away from d253À1536 with speeds as high as \$330 km sÀ1 in the HH 668 microjet and slower motion farther from the star.},

	abstract = {We present ALMA observations of a wide binary system in Orion, with projected separation 440 AU, in which we detect submillimeter emission from the protoplanetary disks around each star. Both disks appear moderately massive and have strong line emission in CO 3–2, HCO+ 4–3, and HCN 3–2. In addition, CS 7–6 is detected in one disk. The line-to-continuum ratios are similar for the two disks in each of the lines. From the resolved velocity gradients across each disk, we constrain the masses of the central stars, and show consistency with optical-infrared spectroscopy, both indicative of a high mass ratio ∼ 9. The small diﬀerence between the systemic velocities indicates that the binary orbital plane is close to face-on. The angle between the projected disk rotation axes is very high, ∼ 72◦, showing that the system did not form from a single massive disk or a rigidly rotating cloud core. This ﬁnding, which adds to related evidence from disk geometries in other systems, protostellar outﬂows, stellar rotation, and similar recent ALMA results, demonstrates that turbulence or dynamical interactions act on small scales well below that of molecular cores during the early stages of star formation.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientiﬁc community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal ﬁve-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientiﬁc goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientiﬁc performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and ﬁndings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientiﬁc performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page at http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia.},

	abstract = {Methods. The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the ﬁrst 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.
Results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330–680 nm) and GRP (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar eﬀective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the ﬁrst optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.
Conclusions. Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a ﬁrst step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

The observations have been carried out in ﬁve photometric ﬁlters nearly equivalent to the standard B, V , Hα, I, and z passbands. Our master catalog lists 178 externally ionized protoplanetary disks (proplyds), 28 disks seen only in absorption against the bright nebular background (silhouette disks), eight disks seen only as dark lanes at the midplane of extended polar emission (bipolar nebulae or reﬂection nebulae), and ﬁve sources showing jet emission with no evidence of either external ionized gas emission or dark silhouette disks. Many of these disks are associated with jets seen in Hα and circumstellar material detected through reﬂection emission in our broadband ﬁlters; approximately two-thirds have identiﬁed counterparts in X-rays. A total of 47 objects (29 proplyds, seven silhouette disks, six bipolar nebulae, ﬁve jets with no evidence of proplyd emission or silhouette disk) are new detections with HST. We include in our list four objects previously reported as circumstellar disks, which have not been detected in our HST/ACS images either because they are hidden by the bleeding trails of a nearby saturated bright star or because of their location out of the HST/ACS Treasury Program ﬁeld. The other 31 sources previously reported as extended objects do not harbor a stellar source in our HST/ACS images. We also report on the detection of 16 red, elongated sources. Their location at the edges of the ﬁeld, far from the Trapezium cluster core ( 10 ), suggests that these are probably background galaxies observed through low-extinction regions of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1).},
