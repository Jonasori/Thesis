- Remake figs. 3.5 3.6 so that they have the printed stuff on them.
- Make Fig. 3.7 a diptych to show where the slice is coming from. Also fix the PVDs axes. Also make the cbar scale go dark to light, rather than dark light dark, since 0 doesn't really have meaning here.
- Fig. 4.1: Keep double DFM corner plots? Worth plotting at all?
- All files: $^o$ -> \degree (works in Table 4.3)
- Integrate DMR chanmaps and DMR m0/m1 together: each row has chanmaps on left, m0 on right -> column of chanmaps, column of m0s.
- check for manual km/s.
- Switch all HCN/CO/CS to \hcn, etc. Allows easier toggling of HCN or HCN(4-3), depending on what Meredith wants.
- Remove space in all Fig. \ref{....}
- Increase label sizes on structure plots.
- you can \ref{} subsections outside of the current chapter; maybe check if that's worth doing in places (rather than just refing the whole chapter.)
- Fig 4.4: Take off disk A's fit (maybe?); at least change its color.



# Far future/never:
- On grid search results diagram, plot a 1-row heatmap of each value sampled (instead of the circled number line)
