### MEREDITH TALKING POINTS


- Questions about B0 in scratch_03.py/get_mass.
  - M(E0 = 0.029) = 7.4e-6 Msol
  - M(E43 = 29) = 2e129 M_sol
  - Did I do/interpret mol mass right?


- Lots of missing Notes

- Getting rid of the DFM corner plots anyways. Useful to have 0? 1?

- Should every instance of HCO/HCN etc have transition? i.e. HCO(4-3) always.

- Forgetting spaces after HCO+: because of set command

- Sig fig rules

- Sharp-eyes meredith on spotting the badness of the last frame of DMR chanmaps

- Structure plots: Wow, thank you! But also why do they look weird?

- What should the captions have? (again)



### Meredith Notes:

- 2nd note in 04


- in 4.CO_fit, explain why the bad values are probably caused by trying to fit cloud contamination.

- Check Cleeves2015 for line strength ratios

- Dartois on vertical

- Andrews, Tripathi, maybe someone else on mass/radius dust ratios


### PLOTTING STUFF

- LOTS TO DO ON PVD: Make Fig. 3.7 a diptych to show where the slice is coming from. Also fix the PVDs axes. Also make the cbar scale go dark to light, rather than dark light dark, since 0 doesn't really have meaning here.
- Increase label sizes on structure plots.


- Fig 4.4: Take off disk A's fit (maybe?); at least change its color.




### TO DO
- Acknowledgements!
- Conclusion!
- Discussion!

- Disk structure plots
- Sort out units on PVD
- Get rid of DFM corner plot right before 4.3 Fitting Procedure



### TEX STUFF

- all arcsecs to \farcs i.e. 0."5 -> 0\farcs5

- AU -> au

- All .tex files: $^o$ -> \degree (works in Table 4.3)

- Switch all HCN/CO/CS to \hcn, etc. Allows easier toggling of HCN or HCN(4-3), depending on what Meredith wants.

- Zeroth or zeroeth?


# Far future/never:

- Integrate DMR chanmaps and DMR m0/m1 together: each row has chanmaps on left, m0 on right -> column of chanmaps, column of m0s.

- On grid search results diagram, plot a 1-row heatmap of each value sampled (instead of the circled number line)

- For moment maps, make two-figure "zoom-ins", e.g. Fig. 2 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09190.pdf

- All the Hanning smoothing stuff: Meredith's comments, FN8 on p3 of Williams2014, Kevin's code, etc.

- Gaia has a bunch of different sources listed at V2434's location? http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/?target=V*%20V2434%20Ori&fov=0.033334&survey=P%2fDSS2%2fcolor
